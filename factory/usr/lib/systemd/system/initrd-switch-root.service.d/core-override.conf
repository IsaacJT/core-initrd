# This empty "ExecStart" does override the original ExecStat from the
# "real" initrd-switch-root.service that would do a stateful re-exec.
ExecStart=
# Currently doing a stateful re-exec will fail. The reasons are a bit
# unclear, it seems to be related to the fact that systemd is confused
# by the mount units in the initrd that are not there in the new pivot
# root. So this systemctl call to "/sbin/init" is a workaround to prevent
# systemd from doing a stateful re-exec (there is no other way to
# prevent this).
#
# Using "/sbin/init" here directly also ensures that the kernel commandline
# "init=" parameter is ignored as it would allow to bypass our protections.
#
# XXX: we should fix this eventually (this may involve upstream work)
# because this also prevents "systemd-analyze time" from displaying
# the time spend in the initrd.
ExecStart=/bin/systemctl --no-block switch-root /sysroot /sbin/init
